# Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis using Python, leveraging essential libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The focus is on analyzing real-world datasets, applying statistical techniques, and visualizing meaningful insights.

*Key Features:

-Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering data, and correcting inconsistencies.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, correlations, and trends using visualizations.

-Data Visualization: Creating impactful graphs and charts using matplotlib and seaborn.

-Statistical Analysis: Applying basic statistical methods to summarize and interpret the data.

*Libraries Used:
-pandas
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-numpy

*Dataset:
We used a publicly available dataset for this project, demonstrating how to manipulate and analyze the data effectively to draw conclusions.

*How It Works:
-The script loads a dataset, cleans the data, and generates visualizations that help in understanding key trends and patterns.
-Each step of the analysis is broken down into well-documented sections for clarity and ease of replication.

*Project Motivation:
-The aim of this project is to help beginners understand the process of data analysis and visualization using Python. By walking through a structured workflow, ----users can learn how to approach data-centric projects with confidence.

*Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests.
